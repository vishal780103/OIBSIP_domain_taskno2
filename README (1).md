#  ATM INTERFACE 

The ATM Interface project is a simple Java-based application that simulates core banking operations such as withdrawal, deposit, checking balance, and transaction history.
It is designed to demonstrate object-oriented programming, user authentication, and basic console interaction in Java.

## Features

 User Authentication (PIN-based login)

 Check Account Balance

 Deposit Amount

 Withdraw Amount

 View Transaction History

 Exit System Safely

 Built using OOP principles (classes, objects, methods)

## HOW IT WORKS

The ATM Interface follows a simple process flow that mimics a real ATM’s basic operations. Below is a step-by-step explanation of how the system works:

When the program starts, the user is asked to enter a PIN.

The entered PIN is checked against the stored PIN in the system.

If the PIN is correct, the user is logged in.

If the PIN is incorrect, access is denied.
